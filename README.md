## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

Meet Adrian Sianodel, a 33 year old half-elven mage who, after several recent catastrophes, managed to land a brief but involuntary stint as Irenicus' pet wandmaker. Kill the duergar who guard him, and he'll be quite happy to lend his magic to your cause. To repay the debt, to exact vengeance... and perhaps because he simply has nowhere else to go anymore.

Adrian has lived an interesting life, for lack of a better term, though he's hoping to finally put his past behind him. Aside from his magic, he has a background in espionage and a decadent -- some might say romantic -- streak that has gotten him into trouble in the past. He once pursued (and ultimately wrecked) a political career with one of the most notorious organizations in the Realms, and may very much enjoy the opportunities for intrigue the Shadow Thieves have to offer... if you can drag him away from fighting with the Harper and the Red Wizard long enough to notice, that is.

Adrian may be somewhat difficult to get to know. He is not the most tolerant of people, and while he is intrigued by your powers and heritage (and has far more experience with the machinations of dark gods than he would like), neither his respect nor his trust is particularly easy to earn. That said, he will appreciate a leader willing to take him to task.

**Content:**
- A colorful new sorcerer NPC.
- Content for SoA, ToB, and BG2:EE.
- Banters with the original Bioware NPCs.
- Optional Voicing.
- Interjections and other commentary.
- New encounters.
- A romance for an eligible female protagonist.
- A friendship path for a protagonist not romancing him.
- Player initiated dialogue and flirts.
- Original portrait by MiLeah

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

Andrian NPC is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/627-adrian/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for the Adrian NPC to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-adrian.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **adrian** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Adrian NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: adrian folder and a setup-adrian.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-adrian.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-adrian.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Adrian NPC for BGII for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: adrian folder, setup-adrian and setup-adrian.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-adrian.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-adrian.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Adrian NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-adrian`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-adrian --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="details" id="details"></a>Details

<img style="float: left;" src="adrian/readme/images/rhadrl.png">
Adrian is Lawful Evil by alignment, but your experience with him may vary. While he has been involved in some unambiguously evil dealings in the past (and is mostly unapologetic about his history), he's not particularly enamored of aimless or obvious villainy. His worldview is influenced by some very dark philosophy, but he isn't a monster. Expect conflict when adding him to a good-aligned party, but don't expect bloodshed.

## 


#### Statistics

- Strength 12
- Dexterity 16
- Constitution 10
- Intelligence 17
- Wisdom 16
- Charisma 14

## 

#### Biography

> When asked about his past, Adrian smiles slightly and says that there are enough demons to face in the present without worrying about yesterday's as well. Given his recent enslavement, it would appear that he has more than a few of his own with which to contend. Despite his slippery responses, you eventually glean that he spent some time in Sembia, working as a hirespell wizard for a rising merchant prince. You quickly learn that further prodding will win you nothing but headaches.

## 

#### NPC Relationships

There will be conflict, occasionally on the edge of violence, but you can keep him with any Bioware NPC without fearing a lethal outcome. Jaheira in particular is recommended, as her presence can significantly affect the epilogue. This is doubly true if you are romancing him.

## 

#### Classes

Adrian was conceived of as a sorcerer, but his character and history lend themselves to the cleric/mage and mage/thief multiclasses as well. For this reason, both are included as alternative installation choices. Dialogue may vary in places to take this into account. Installing him as a sorcerer is still recommended, but both alternatives are internally consistent.

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="romance" id="romance"></a>Romance

#### Requirements

- **Gender:** Adrian will only romance a female protagonist.
- **Race:** Adrian will only romance humans or half-elves.
- **Alignment:** No restrictions.
- **Class restrictions:** No restrictions.
- **Stat restrictions:** INT 12+ and CHR 12+. Adrian admires a keen mind and a strong personality.

## 

#### Notes

- The romance doesn't start immediately. There are a handful of early talks, but the actual romance will not begin until after you have completed his quest.
- Adrian is not particularly thin-skinned. While a PC who treats him overly harshly is unlikely to gain his trust, Adrian values a strong will and prefers a woman who can stand up for herself. Overly righteous or naive behavior will not impress, nor will he care for a stereotypically Chaotic Evil protagonist.
- The first talk will trigger upon resting in an inn after escaping Irenicus's dungeon. There are several other talks that trigger upon rest as well.
- If the romance has stalled, try resting in a forest.
- Reaching the committed stage of the romance before arriving at Spellhold is recommended. You may miss out on some content otherwise.
- Anyone can attempt to flirt with Adrian, but the actual flirtpack will not be available until after you have completed his quest and the romance has begun. Once the romance commits, you can ask him to initiate flirts as well.

As of v5.0, the installer groups optional classes and soundsets components into two components, letting the player decide which one he/she wants to install.

**0. Adrian is a Sorcerer**  
**1. Change Adrian's class to Cleric/Mage**  
**2. Change Adrian's class to Mage/Thief**

## 

**[10-11] Install optional soundset for Adrian** (only in English)  
**10. Phaelin's soundset**  
**11. Tatterdemalion's soundset**

## 

**[20] Crossmod content** (only in English)

This component installs banters between Adrian and Angelo, Arath, Coran (Kulyok's mod), Darian, Faren, Gavin, Iylos, Kivan of Shilmista, Nephele, Ninde, Tiax (Kulyok's mod), Xan (Kulyok's mod) and Xulaye, if those mods are detected.
